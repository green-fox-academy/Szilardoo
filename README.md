Initiating an AJAX request || Here i use callback too.
- https://github.com/greenfox-academy/Szilardoo/blob/master/Week8/day4/gyphAPI.html#L35
... a General Ajax request.
- https://github.com/greenfox-academy/Szilardoo/blob/master/todo/assets/communication.js#L5


xhr.open('TYPE', url, true)
Setting it to true means you are making an asynchronous request.
That means the code does not pause until the http request is complete.

There is a lot callback, to explain these i need an other file, this general ajax, 
which i already put it in to the previous example:
